# üõ† Text Processing API with Alerts

This project provides a simple FastAPI-based web service that accepts text input, processes it asynchronously via Celery, tuning into lowercase (it can be any API and ML operation), and generates alerts for suspicious or sensitive content. All operations are logged, and alerts are saved as timestamped reports.

## üì¶ Architecture Overview

### üß© Components

| Component        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FastAPI App**  | HTTP interface that receives text input and dispatches background jobs.     |
| **Celery Worker**| Asynchronous task runner for processing input and generating alerts.        |
| **Redis**        | Broker and backend for Celery task queuing and result storage.              |
| **Logger**       | Logs all API inputs, task submissions, and results to file and console.     |
| **Alert Engine** | Saves alerts to disk as timestamped `.txt` files in `error_reports/`.       |

## üîÑ Execution Flow

1. **Synchronous Operation**
   - FastAPI receives a plain-text `POST /process` request.
   - The text is logged and passed to a background task (non-blocking).
   - API responds **immediately** with `200 OK` and the Celery task ID.

2. **Asynchronous Operation**
   - Celery worker receives the task and processes it:
     - Converts input to lowercase.
     - Detects keywords (`fraud`, `password`, `ssn`, or empty input).
     - If found, triggers `generate_alert()` which saves an alert file.
   - Logs input and final processed result.

## üìà Scaling Strategy

| Simultaneous Users | Scaling Approach                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **10 Users**       | Single FastAPI instance + 1 Celery worker + 1 Redis instance is sufficient.       |
| **50 Users**       | Increase Celery workers to 3‚Äì5. Use `gunicorn -w 4` to serve FastAPI concurrently.|
| **100+ Users**     | Run FastAPI with `gunicorn -w 8`, scale Redis (hosted/cloud), and Celery workers (5‚Äì10). Consider queue monitoring (e.g. Flower) and distributed task runners. Use container orchestration (Docker Compose/Kubernetes). |

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

### üîß Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Redis server running locally (`redis://localhost:6379/0`)

### üî® Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourname/text-processing-alerts.git
cd text-processing-alerts

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### üîå Start Services

```bash
# Building service
docker compose up

# Start Celery worker
celery -A app.tasks worker --loglevel=info

# Checking test results
test.py
```
You can also write your prompts in **test.py** file to proceed

## üß™ Results

### ‚úÖ Normal Input

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/process -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "Hello world"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "message": "Task submitted",
  "task_id": "4f14a0ae-3e26-4d9f-80fd-a3ad24e69f23"
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Sensitive Input (password)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/process -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "My password is 1234"
```

Creates a new alert file in `error_reports/` such as:

```text
Time: 2025-05-17T15:43:01.123456
Alert Type: Personal Data
Description: User sent sensitive data: My password is 1234
```
